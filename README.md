# Day pick or Nasa pico

A website where you can view daily pictures captured by NASA. 
The website uses Nasa API to retrieve the info and for the front end, I have used python with help of Django.

The Pictures are not the best they could be because of size. The only purpose of this project was to test Nasa API.
## What's the link?

I have used Heroku to deploy the website and it was such a headache but here it is, Enjoy.
